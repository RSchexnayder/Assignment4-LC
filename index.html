    <h1>Violet: The Legacy of a House Bunny</h1>
<section>
<h2>A Life Before Rescue</h2>
<p> Violet’s prior life was one not one to be envied. She was kept in a small cage, not even big enough for you to stretch out and stand up in. The house that held that cage was filthy. The owner was a hoarder with a smoking addiction. Violet lived a life behind bars, hiding what little food she did receive from the roaches that lived in her cage with her. She would dig and bury her pellets to keep them safe while she ate them. She had little interaction with humans and was scared of new people. This was her reality for the first year of her life. </p>
<h2> Violets early start to a normal life </h2>
<p> After rescuing Violet, I started to recognize several behaviors that pointed back to an unfortunate life prior to me. She continued to bury her food in the soft blankets and bed that I had given her. It was weeks before she was convinced that the food she was being given was not going to disappear if she didn’t eat it fast enough. She was unsure of all the new foods she was given, like hay (which should have been 80% of her diet her entire life), and fresh veggies! She would hide when we came into the room and flick her feet at us if we tried to touch her. She was very unsure of her new environment. </p>
<h2> Violets personality: A house bunny given proper care </h2>
<p>After having Violet for several weeks, she began to flourish! We started to see the personality she never had a chance to show! We found that she loved carpet. It was her favorite flooring to run and play on and she would jump in joy anytime she was allowed in a carpeted room. She was mischievous and tried very hard to nibble on any wires (spicy spaghetti!) that she could find.  She loved cilantro. She chewed her heart out with cardboard boxes and loved when she could climb inside. She started to realize that she was safe! She would come up to me for cuddles and head pats and would stretch out showing how relaxed she was. We would take her out on walks in the park, and she loved running around, eating grass, and the occasional person that would come up to her to give her a few head pats as well! She loved bike rides, and her backpack that let her see everything around her when we would take her out. She indulged in all the best parts of life she was never given before! She was fearless and curious. She was the best bunny a person could ask for. </p>
